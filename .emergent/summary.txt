The trajectory documents the iterative development of Doloop, a recurring checklist mobile application, from its initial MVP specification to a feature-rich prototype. The initial phase focused on scaffolding the Expo (React Native) frontend and FastAPI backend, setting up basic authentication, and implementing core CRUD operations for Loops and Tasks.

Development then became highly user-driven, with the user providing UI mockups and specific feature requests. Key evolutions included a shift from a simple dashboard to a categorized home screen (My Day, Important), the introduction of an AI-powered loop creation feature using an Emergent LLM key, and the implementation of a Favorites system.

A significant portion of the recent work involved troubleshooting a non-functional delete button. After multiple failed attempts to fix the button on an edit screen, the AI engineer, guided by explicit user feedback, pivoted to a more intuitive swipe-to-delete gesture on the main dashboard. This involved implementing a soft-delete mechanism on the backend, adding gesture handling libraries to the frontend, and creating a new screen for users to view and restore deleted loops. The project's current state is immediately after the creation of this deleted loops recovery system.

<product_requirements>
The project is to build Doloop, a mobile-first, looping to-do list application for managing routines and recurring checklists.

**Core MVP Requirements:**
- **User Authentication:** Basic email and password sign-in.
- **Loop Management:** Users can create, view, and manage Loops (reusable checklists).
- **Task Management:** Within each loop, users can add recurring or one-time tasks and mark them as complete.
- **Reloop Functionality:** A mechanism to reset all recurring tasks within a loop.

**Evolved Requirements (based on user feedback):**
- **Categorized Dashboard:** The main screen should organize loops into categories like My Day, Important, and Favorites, rather than a single list.
- **AI-Powered Creation:** Users should be able to generate a loop and its tasks by providing a natural language prompt to an AI.
- **Favorites System:** Users must be able to mark loops as favorites for quick access, with a heart icon toggle on each loop card.
- **Collapsible Tasks:** In the loop detail view, task action items (edit, delete, etc.) should be hidden by default and expandable via a toggle to maintain a clean UI.
- **Swipe-to-Delete with Recovery:** Instead of a button, users must be able to delete loops by swiping left on the main list. Deleted loops should be moved to a Deleted Loops section for 30 days, from where they can be permanently deleted or restored.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo, using file-based routing with .
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI server connected to a MongoDB database.
- **State Management:** React Context API () for authentication state.
- **UI & Gestures:** Standard React Native components, with  for implementing swipe-to-delete functionality.
- **AI Integration:** Backend integration with an LLM via  and an  to provide AI-powered content generation.
- **Database Logic:** Soft-deletion pattern implemented by adding  and  fields to the Loop model.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with separate  and  directories. The frontend is a mobile-first Expo application utilizing file-based routing.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**
-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the sole backend file, containing the entire FastAPI application logic. It defines all API endpoints, database models (using Pydantic), user authentication (JWT), and business logic.
    -   **Changes:** Heavily modified to add endpoints for user registration/login, CRUD for loops and tasks, AI loop generation (), toggling favorites, and soft-deleting/restoring loops.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main dashboard and home screen of the application. It fetches and displays user loops.
    -   **Changes:** Evolved from a simple list to a complex, categorized dashboard. It now displays Favorites and Recent Loops sections. The  component was replaced with  to enable the swipe-to-delete functionality.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The loop detail screen, where users view and interact with the tasks of a specific loop.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to include collapsible task items, where action buttons (like edit/delete) are initially hidden. An Edit button was added to the header to navigate to the edit screen. The non-functioning delete button was moved here and subsequently removed.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A new, crucial component for the user experience, implementing the swipe-to-delete gesture.
    -   **Changes:** Created to wrap each loop card on the dashboard. It uses  to detect a left swipe, triggering an API call to soft-delete the loop.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The recovery screen for soft-deleted loops.
    -   **Changes:** A new screen created to fetch and display loops marked as . It provides functionality for users to restore a loop or delete it permanently.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The root layout file for . It configures the global navigation structure (Stack navigator) and wraps the application in necessary providers like .
    -   **Changes:** Modified to add new screens to the navigation stack, such as , , and to hide the default header on the  screen to fix a UI issue.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Library Page:** The user provided a design for a Library page with search and categorization, which was acknowledged but not implemented.
- **Add Link to Deleted Loops:** The  screen was created and added to the navigation router, but no UI element (e.g., a button or link on the dashboard) was added to allow the user to navigate to it.
- **Implement Shared Loops:** The initial MVP specification included shared loops and assigning tasks, which has not been addressed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was a complete overhaul of the loop deletion functionality, prompted by user frustration with a non-working delete button. The AI engineer successfully pivoted from a button-based approach to a more intuitive swipe-to-delete user experience.

This involved several coordinated changes:
1.  **Backend ():** The Loop model was updated to support soft deletes by adding  and  fields. The DELETE endpoint was modified to perform a soft delete (setting ), and new endpoints were added to restore or permanently delete loops. The main endpoint for fetching loops () was updated to exclude soft-deleted items.
2.  **Frontend ():** The  library was added as a dependency.
3.  **Frontend ():** A new component was created to wrap individual loop cards. It uses the  component from the gesture handler library to render a Delete button when a user swipes left.
4.  **Frontend ():** The main dashboard was updated to use the new  for rendering loops. The entire view was wrapped in a  as required by the library.
5.  **Frontend ():** A new screen was created to display soft-deleted loops, allowing users to restore or permanently delete them.
6.  **Frontend ():** The new  screen was added to the Stack navigator to make it a valid route.

The work concluded immediately after adding the  screen to the navigation stack.

<optional_next_step>
Add a link or button on the main dashboard () that navigates the user to the newly created Deleted Loops screen ().
