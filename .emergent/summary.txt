The trajectory outlines the iterative development of Doloop, a recurring checklist application, from its initial MVP to a feature-rich prototype. The process has been highly user-driven, with development shifting from core backend and frontend scaffolding to implementing specific UI mockups and feature requests.

Key development phases included building CRUD operations, integrating an AI for loop creation, and implementing a swipe-to-delete feature with a soft-delete mechanism. However, the recent development cycle has been fraught with significant challenges. An attempt to implement a dark mode feature introduced a critical Cannot access styles before initialization error in the  screen. This was due to misusing a React hook () within a  call, which executes at module load time rather than component render time.

Multiple failed attempts to fix this led to user frustration and a series of rollbacks using usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

See 'git help git' for an overview of the system.. These rollbacks, in turn, created dependency-related crashes, as the code required packages (, ) that were no longer installed. The project was only stabilized after the user provided detailed, step-by-step debugging instructions from an external source (Grok), which successfully resolved the dependency issues. The current work involves cautiously re-implementing the draggable list feature, following another precise guide from Grok.

<product_requirements>
The project is to build Doloop, a mobile application for managing recurring checklists.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in.
*   **Loop Management:** Users can create, view, edit, and delete Loops (checklists). Functionality includes AI-powered creation, marking loops as favorites, and a soft-delete system with a recovery screen.
*   **Task Management:** Within a loop, users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks can have due dates, notes, tags, file/image attachments, and can be assigned to other users (via email).

**UI/UX Requirements:**
*   **Dashboard:** A home screen with collapsible sections (My Day, Important, Your Loops). Loop cards should be draggable to reorder and minimizable to show only the title and completion percentage.
*   **Loop Detail Screen:** A clean, elegant design that uses visual icons (for assignments, attachments, notes, due dates) on each task item instead of expandable menus. Tasks within a loop must also be draggable to reorder.
*   **Theming:** The app must support both light and dark modes, with the theme applied consistently across all screens. Users should be able to select custom colors for their loops.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo, TypeScript.
- **Routing:** File-based routing with .
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI server with a MongoDB database.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based, with tokens stored on the client using .
- **State Management:** React Context API (, ).
- **UI & Gestures:**  for swiping,  and  for drag-and-drop reordering.
- **Database Logic:** Soft-deletion pattern ( flag).
- **AI Integration:** Backend uses  for LLM-powered content generation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with distinct  and  directories.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains the entire FastAPI application, defining all API endpoints, Pydantic models for data validation, and database logic for users, loops, and tasks.
    -   **Changes:** The  model was significantly extended to include fields for , , , , and . Endpoints for updating and deleting tasks were verified, and a new endpoint for reordering loops is planned.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main dashboard screen. It displays the user's loops in collapsible categories.
    -   **Changes:** It was heavily modified to support dark mode, a collapsible Your Loops section, and was prepared for drag-and-drop reordering by installing dependencies. State management was being migrated from local  to the new .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The screen for viewing and managing tasks within a specific loop. This has been the most volatile file.
    -   **Changes:** This file underwent numerous major refactors. Functionality was added for all task actions (due dates, attachments, etc.). It was redesigned to use visual icons. A critical bug was introduced here when implementing a theme system, causing an app-wide crash (Cannot access styles before initialization). The file was rolled back and is currently in a stable, light-mode-only state. It is slated to be made draggable.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A newly created file to manage the global state of loops, centralizing logic for fetching, updating, and reordering.
    -   **Changes:** Created based on a guide. It includes logic to fetch loops from the backend, store them in state, persist them to  for offline use, and provides a  function for the upcoming drag-and-drop feature. Its introduction caused a temporary blank screen issue.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The root layout file for the app, responsible for setting up navigation and wrapping the app in global context providers.
    -   **Changes:** It was modified to add the  to the chain of contexts. It was also a source of a crash during the rollback phase when it tried to import a deleted .
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of drag-to-reorder for loops on the dashboard and tasks on the loop detail screen, following the provided guide.
- Implement a custom color picker for loops.
- Implement the Library page based on the user's design.
- Implement the functionality for assigning tasks to other users.
- Re-implement a stable, app-wide dark mode that works on all screens.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The current task is to correctly implement drag-and-drop reordering for loops, following a detailed, step-by-step guide provided by the user (from a source named Grok). This effort was initiated after a series of critical failures and rollbacks related to implementing a dark mode theme, which left the app in an unstable state.

**Progress So Far:**
1.  **Dependencies Installed:** The necessary libraries (, ) were successfully installed, and the Expo server was restarted with a cleared cache.
2.  **Context Created:** A new global state management context, , was created to handle all loop-related data, including the logic for reordering.
3.  **Provider Integrated:** The root layout () was updated to wrap the application with the new .

**Current Blocker:**
After integrating the , the application started rendering a blank screen. The user has provided another detailed troubleshooting guide to diagnose and fix this blank screen issue, which is the immediate next step. The problem is likely related to how the initial data is being loaded or handled within the newly created .
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Follow the user's troubleshooting guide to fix the blank screen. I will start by adding  statements inside the  hook in  to debug the data loading from .
